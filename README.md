Brent Oil Price Analysis
Overview
This project examines the influence of major political, economic, and geopolitical events on Brent oil prices. By analyzing historical data from 1987 to 2022, the project aims to provide actionable insights for:
Investors: Helping to inform portfolio strategies by understanding how external events impact oil prices.
Policymakers: Offering data-driven insights that could guide energy policy and strategic planning.
Energy Companies: Assisting in risk management and forecasting for market fluctuations.
The analysis leverages statistical methods and visualizations to uncover trends and correlations between significant global events and oil price movements.
Data
Source: Historical Brent oil prices (1987–2022).
Fields: 
oDate: The date of the recorded oil price.
oPrice: The closing price of Brent crude oil on the given date.
Location:
The raw dataset is stored at data/raw/brent_oil_prices.csv.
Additional data cleaning and preprocessing steps are applied to ensure the dataset’s consistency and reliability for analysis.
